The tool will track and differentiate the performance of customer services versus goods provided by a company over time. Yelp provides customer feedback with a star rating and review. The star rating does not provide specific reasons why the business earns the rating. We will take data from Yelp and use NLP to find reviews that address a business's customer service or product quality.  We will use Yelp datasets available on their website for educational use.The dataset is a subset of Yelps businesses, reviews, and users.

* Task Topic modelling for funsies to see what the reviews main topics are based on

* Task - Write code tokenize words in dataset to see what words are common and which words people use to describe our different word distributions. Record output and show that we manually choose useful thetas in our sentiment analysis.
* Task - Define 
  Theta 1 for Good Reviews Service
  Theta 2 for Bad Service
  Theta 3 for Good Quality Goods and products
  Theta 4 for Bad quality Goods and products

Theta Background
* Task  -Filter data collected using user inputs.
* Task  -Clustering data to facilitate browsing. Define similatry function to cluster. Should we use user input to define clustering and allow for ranking? What is cutoff 10 items? 
* Task  -Test Clustering and visualize differences.
