When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.

The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.

I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation.",uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,5,2016-07-12,0,0

Pros:
Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.
Very clean and very good maid service

Cons:
Tiny rooms 
Uncomfortable bed 
Absolutely no amenities 
No phone in room 
No wardrobe 

Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me... 

If you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into.",uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,3,2016-10-02,0,0
0,AXgRULmWcME7J6Ix3I--ww,ne5WhI1jUFOcRn-b-gAzHA,"Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere.

Wir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nächte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.

Das Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.
Unser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.
Sonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.

Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.

Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.

Das Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.

Für ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen.

They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!,uYHaNptLzDLoV_JZ_MuzUA,4,2016-08-21,0,0

Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. 

Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. 

Don't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel.

Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.

Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.

My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. 

Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone.

Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.
We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.

Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.

The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.

On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.

I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.

Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.

Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea.

With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)

the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)

I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.

Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us.

We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!

Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...

As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. 

Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)",jQsNFOzDpxPmOurSWCg1vQ,4,2008-10-06,0,0

I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................

Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.

Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!

Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.

Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  

Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.

The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.

Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.

Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.

They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he ""let us keep the spring rolls"" and ""didn't charge is for all of our drinks"" as if he did us a favor.

When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. 
The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?

0,djpMXOA1ic5wv3FPtubHNw,Z5l99h18E3_g1GLcDSsWqA,"I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent. Meh as others would put it. Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.

The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!

My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2009-07-21,3,0
0,-pXs08gJq9ExIk275YLvPg,Z3Fw292i0Eg8liW0DT1jsw,"for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three.  okay. lets break it down.

the service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.

for lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.

that being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of ""well then what the hell is he complaining about"").

the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.

i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.

all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2008-12-13,1,0

Food is always consistent, have never not liked anything I have ordered. 

Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.

Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.

The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.

I found myself here ordering the much touted ""Hot Balls"" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the ""Diver Scallops"" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the ""Leg of Lamb"" and ""Wild Stripped Bass"" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. 

The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. 

Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.

I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2010-06-07,3,1

My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick.

0,qt1b6zXExL-uoJGRRouQYw,rUnkJt8Mm4OpvXzJac9P-w,"I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!). 

The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. 

Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. 

The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. 

I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem ""fried"" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the ""Sloppy"" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough). 
My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2011-02-27,0,0

The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!
We had...
Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.
Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.
Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!

Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( 

The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing!

0,bCPO7i-x5eZ41lLVOwuQwQ,RNiNQyQ78zvKunbP09ChJw,"On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.

Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.

Right off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. 

Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.

And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his ""little neglected table."" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.

Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the ""shared food"" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. 

Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a ""sugo"" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.

Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained ""sauce & balls"" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were ""al dente"" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.

Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's ""Anna 6"" white was very dry and very refreshing. 

In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was ""out"" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.

Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.
This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.

I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2009-08-10,3,0

Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.

I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.

Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.

The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as ""Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue""?! 

Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. 

Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion.

Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.

Food:
The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.

To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. 

For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.

My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. 

We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.

Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.

Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.

And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty.

1,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,650QSmmJ_MaF4WN1V_gFZA,"""Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,"" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.

I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.

The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.

A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.

I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.


Oysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.

We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.

For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).

The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit ""salad"" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.

Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.

Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.

As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.

The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.

Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.

POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.

Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. 

The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.

Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks ""might as well get your money's worth, right?"". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher. 

After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. 

The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. 

I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. 

Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!

All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light.

The good:
- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality
- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees
- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu
- They do potato rosti right
- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon
- Good service both times I've been
- Proximity to my house
- they use opentable

The bad:
- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.
- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)

No funny stories.

I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. 

I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. 

Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). 

We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. 

I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. 

We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2009-08-07,2,2

What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. 

And so it goes...

 I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. 

The service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. 

The food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. 

Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). 

We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. 

I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,3,2010-09-08,3,3

Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint
My friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. 

Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale
I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. 

Entrée:

Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish
Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. 

Dessert:

Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom!

As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. 

The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.

The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. 

The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. 

The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me.

To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices.

I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.

The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.

Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.

Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!

P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,5,2013-03-23,0,0

The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!

After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.

Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner.

With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.

The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)

For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.

It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.

On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.

For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.

I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint.",mr4FiPaXTWlJ3qGzp4-7Yg,4,2013-04-28,0,0

Conveniently located near Jilly's (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place.

I tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate.

The hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it's own dipping sauce. I think these are a ""must have"" if you come here.

The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .

It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot.

The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.

My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. 

Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.

Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.

I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. 

My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. 

I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.

Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. 

I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. 

For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.

Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious.

Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.

The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.

The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.

First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.  

My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.  

As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.  

Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.

After searching for a new place for a couple of months, I settled on Acacia Creek.  I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough.  One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day.  So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease.

Right before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount.  I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago.  We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused.

I pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online.  Her defense was that ""[their] prices change every day,"" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line.

I tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again.  I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong!  She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on.

I have no idea why she couldn't say something like, ""Our website isn't accurate - you should call,"" or, ""Let me see what I can do"" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates.

That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing! 

Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) 

The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101. 

The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun).

You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care).

I can't give the Shoppes at the Palazzo any less than 5 stars because they market, advertise, and sell MONEY.  That's their main goal.  Put a bunch of high end stores together and make money.  Since they accomplish their goal, you can't fault them for it.  When it comes to expensive goodies, might as well set it up correctly and at one of the more classier casinos like the Palazzo.  All the stores are maintained, clean, and have some of the best service ever, like ever.  

I've only been here a half dozen times and never bought anything due to my wine taste/beer budget.  But I can tell you one thing, you're never stereotyped here, you're never treated like you don't belong, and you're never more than a minute in a store without great service.  My issue...I just can't justify some of the expenses.

They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. 

My friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, ""That one is $1400."" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says ""Okay,"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!

Nothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself?

They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.

The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!

My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.

One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.

You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.

8,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A,8FvVPvTaMJAM5drD18JxAA,"I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.

When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.

My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!

While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!",MKd_EUD0PG__cOfIbeqYAg,4,2015-02-10,14,10

When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed.  Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat.

However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the ""Kokeicha"". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of ""gunpowder"" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the ""Kokeicha"" was very similar.

The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own.

I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it.

The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations.  The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people.

The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do.  It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin.

They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere.

Since I came to Pittsburgh 4 years ago, this place has been my favorite location for some serious work. Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself. 

They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from.

If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you.

One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter.

The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop.

The whole interior is a lot more trendy and reflective of our times and the big name brands and boutiques that have settled in the Mail.
Everything is a glossy white marble, clean and sleek.  Lots of natural sunlight coming from glass rooftop openings. The food court is also impressive, they've expanded the seating area by shutting down one of the stores on the side. Color combination and lighting makes this place a whole lot more appealing.

Since the building of the Dix 30 mega outdoor shopping lifestyle complex, Mail Champlain has had to renew itself to retain shoppers. The opening of the Forever 21 store was one of their best moves. They also appeal to a higher class of shoppers with big brands like BCBG and Browns shoes. Even The Bay has undergone a slight revamp - on the main floor, they've rearranged their handbag and shoe department to make way for name brands.

I used to see mostly elderly people wandering around during the week, it didn't seem like a popular hangout place for youngings but that has changed.

He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. 

Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).

As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so.",xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA,4,2013-08-09,1,2

Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait.  We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us.
Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks.
30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was ""didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?"" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they ""were just catching up"". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area.
5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it.",xOx-N9G7AteZTnZfVFfNHA,1,2013-06-20,1,0

Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat.  We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.   
The menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the ""baskets"" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.

The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do.

My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.

Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich ""your way"" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread...

Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.

Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.

Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.

Overall: Great little lunch cafe!",_mqUzNXs_sJ1EJYgYZYszg,4,2016-08-04,1,0

I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one.

While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked ""how old is the bread?"" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying ""the bread is fresh."" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not?

Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.",wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA,2,2016-07-26,1,1

I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail. 

I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available.",wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA,3,2015-12-22,6,2

I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.

This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.

I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.

Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection.",wtazPNyIbsRMHmrpEYbqZA,3,2015-07-22,1,0

It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part.

I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place.

Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. 

I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.

Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. 

Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. 

Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back.",OQcvO5P3gH0cuJ-bPXwfQQ,4,2017-06-20,66,67

I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. 

Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. 

I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. 

While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. 

My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce.
